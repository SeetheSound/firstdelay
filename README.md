# firstdelay

Hey this is from a tutorial I followed to get an idea of how C++ works. This is not an original design, but more of a learning project to learn how C++ works and the juce framework. All credit goes to Joshua Hodge. He is a great programmer and I have learned so much from the tutorials


This plugin was built to get an understanding of the juce frame work and a circular buffer. I learned the from the audio programmers group so again THIS IS NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK. 

On a side note if you want to listen to some great music check out slum village and pink siifu. Great relaxed vibes you can drive to when gas is not expensive.
